## The Kepler-K2 Cadence Events Application

Since early 2018, the Kepler/K2 project has been performing a uniform global reprocessing of data from K2 Campaigns 0 through 14. Subsequent K2 campaigns (C15-C19) are being processed using the same processing pipeline. One of the major benefits of the reprocessing effort is that, for the first time, short-cadence (1-min) light curves are produced in addition to the standard long-cadence (30-min) light curves. Users have been cautioned that the Kepler pipeline detrending module (PDC), developed for use on original Kepler data, has not been tailored for use on short-cadence K2 observations. Systematics due to events on fast timescales,  such as thruster firings, are sometimes poorly corrected for many short-cadence targets. A Python data visualization and manipulation tool, called Kepler-K2 Cadence Events, has been developed that identifies and removes cadences associated with problematic thruster events, thus producing better light curves. Kepler-K2 Cadence Events can be used to visualize and manipulate light curve files and target pixel files from the Kepler, K2, and TESS missions.  We anticipate this software will be available from <http://code.nasa.gov> 

## Prequisites

The Kepler-K2 Cadence Events application should run on any computer with Python 3 .  The application was developed using the open-source Anaconda Distribution of Python 2.7 which is available at <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution>.  K2CE has now been ported to Python 3.7.3.

The application uses Lightkurve (<http://docs.lightkurve.org/>) which is a community-developed, open-source Python package which offers a "beautiful and user-freindly way to analyze astronomical flux time seris data".  It was specifically designed to analyze the pixels and lightcurves obtained by NASA's Kepler, K2, and TESS exoplanet missions. Installation instructions are given at the following webpage: <http://docs.lightkurve.org/about/install.html>.

## Running the Code

### As a Stand-Alone Application from the Command Line

(1) Copy the Python application (k2\_cadence\_events.py) into the local directory.

(2) Make sure that the code is executable by typing (using MacOS X or Linux)

	chmod u+x k2_cadence_events.py

(3) The application can be run without any arguments.  

If you type the following command from the command line, you will see a demonstration of the application:

	./k2_cadence_events.py
	
You should see something like this:

<pre>
./k2_cadence_events.py 
**********************************************
Kepler K2 Cadence Events (k2ce): Version 0.79
**********************************************

*******************************************************
***** Use --help to see the command line options. *****
*******************************************************


Using default target (exoplanet K2-99b):

  from_archive=True
  target=212803289
  campaign=17
  cadence=short

filename=/Users/kmighell/.lightkurve-cache/mastDownload/K2/ktwo212803289-c17_sc/ktwo212803289-c17_slc.fits

Kepler/K2 short cadence Light Curve File

K2 Campaign 17

target: EPIC 212803289

98490 cadences

Using default bitmask value of 1605636.

The bitmask value of 1605636 = 110001000000000000100

translates as

['Coarse point', 'Possible thruster firing', 'Thruster firing', 'No fine point']

</pre>

A plot should appear on your screen like this:

![](README_fig1.png)

Once you are ready to leave the application, close the plot window (MacOS X: click on the red button on the upper-right corner of the plot window).

The application ends by writing a little more information:

<pre>
1635 events

1635 cadences flagged
</pre>

The demo plot shows the short cadence observations of EPIC 212803289
(exoplanet: K2-99b) that were obtained during K2 Campaign 17.

The short-cadence K2 light curve file was downloaded automatically from
the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) at the Space
Telescope Science Institute (STScI).

The **red points** are the observations that had a SAP_QUALITY value with either Bit21
(1048576 = (2\*\*20)) and/or Bit20 (524288 = (2\*\*19)) and/or Bit16 (32768 =
(2\*\*15)) and/or (4 = (2\*\*2)) set -- which indicates (1) an actual or
(2) probable thruster firing event, or the ***Kepler*** spacecraft was in (3) coarse point or (4) not in fine point **during an individual cadence observation**.

The **blue points** in the scatter plot are the "**good observations**" that ***did not*** have at least one of these bits set.

Of the total of 98490 short-cadence observations, 1635 (1.66%) of the cadences were flagged as being a "cadence event".

The grey vertical bars near the top of the plot show events.
The darker the grey, the greater the number of events in time.

The name of the Kepler/K2 short cadence light curve file analysed is shown
on the right side of the plot. Note that this is where the file is stored
locally.

### As a part of a Python script

(1) Using your favorite editor, cut-and-paste the following text to create a
Python script called **spud.py**:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
import os
import k2_cadence_events as k2ce
nargs = len(sys.argv) - 1
if (nargs == 0):
    # interactive mode: no arguments
    k2ce.k2_cadence_events()
else: 
    # non-interactive mode: first argument is the name of the plotfile (e.g., foo.png)
    plotfile=sys.argv[1]  
    if (os.path.isfile(plotfile)):  # abort if file already exists
        print '***** ERROR ***** Requested file already exists: ',plotfile
    else:
        k2ce.k2_cadence_events(plotfile=plotfile)
        print
        print 'Show the docstring for k2_cadence_events() :'
        print k2ce.k2_cadence_events.__doc__
#EOF
</pre>

(2) Make sure that the script is executable by typing 

	chmod u+x spud.py
	
(3) You can execute the script in its interactive mode (using no arguments):

	./spud.py
	
(4) You can execute the script in its non-interactive mode using the first argument as the name of the output plotfile (e.g., spud_plot.png):

	./spud.py spud_plot.png
	
After the plot is written the Python docstring for k2\_cadence\_envents() is shown.
